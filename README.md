bootstrap-colorselector
=======================

A colorselector for Twitter Bootstrap which lets you select a color from a predefined set of colors only.

In contrast to many other colorpickers found on Github this one is reduced to a predefined set of colors.
This is why it is called "colorselector" rather than "colorpicker".
