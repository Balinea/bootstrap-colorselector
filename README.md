bootstrap-colorselector
=======================

A colorselector for Twitter Bootstrap which lets you select a color from a predefined set of colors.

In contrast to many other colorpickers found on Github this one is reduced to a predefined set of colors.
This is why it is called "colorselector" rather than "colorpicker".

Inspired (and partly forked) by:

https://github.com/tkrotoff/jquery-simplecolorpicker

https://github.com/lauren/pick-a-color

Thanks to both for their inspiration and ideas.
